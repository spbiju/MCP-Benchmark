Deliver this as a detailed markdown artifact that resembles a professional MLB scouting report.

STEP 1: PLAYER IDENTIFICATION & BASIC INFO
1. Use lookup_player("{player_name}") to find the player and get their MLB ID
2. If multiple players are found, select the most relevant/current one
3. Use get_playerid_lookup() if needed for additional player identification

STEP 2: DETERMINE PLAYER TYPE & GET CORE STATS
1. Use get_player_stats(player_id, group="hitting") to get batting stats
2. Use get_player_stats(player_id, group="pitching") to get pitching stats
3. Based on which stats are more relevant, determine if this is primarily a:
   - BATTER: Focus on hitting stats, batting visualizations
   - PITCHER: Focus on pitching stats, pitcher visualizations
   - TWO-WAY PLAYER: Include both hitting and pitching analysis

STEP 3: GET ADVANCED METRICS (STATCAST DATA) - PRIMARY SOURCE FOR CONTACT QUALITY
**IMPORTANT: Use Statcast tools for ALL exit velocity and contact quality analysis**

        Prompt for generating structured plot list for Web UI

    return f"""Generate a comprehensive set of plots for the game between \
{team1} and {team2} on {date}.

Your response should be a list of plot objects in this exact JSON format:
[
  {{"plot_base64": "<BASE64_STRING>", "plot_title": "<TITLE>"}},
  {{"plot_base64": "<BASE64_STRING>", "plot_title": "<TITLE>"}},
  ...
]

STEP 1: FIND THE GAME
1. Use get_schedule(date="{date}", team_id=None) to get all games on {date}
2. Filter the schedule results to find the game between {team1} and \
{team2}
3. Extract the game_id (or game_pk) from the matching game
4. If no game found between these teams on this date, inform the user and \
suggest checking the date or team abbreviations

STEP 2: CONSIDER RELEVANT PLOTS
For game analysis, determine which plots would be most relevant:
- create_strike_zone_plot: Pitcher locations and batter approach for the game
- create_spraychart_plot: All batted balls from the game with outcomes
- create_bb_profile_plot: Game-specific distributions (exit velocity, launch angle, pitch velocity)
- create_teams_plot: Team performance comparison for this specific game

STEP 3: ACQUIRE DATA
1. Get basic game information:
   - get_boxscore(game_id) for final score and basic stats
   - get_linescore(game_id) for inning-by-inning breakdown
2. Get detailed game data:
   - **get_statcast_single_game(game_id) - PRIMARY source for all plotting data**
   - get_game_scoring_play_data(game_id) for key moments context

STEP 4: GENERATE PLOTS
Create these specific plots using the single-game Statcast data:

1. create_spraychart_plot(statcast_game_data, title="{team1} @ {team2} - \
All Batted Balls • {date}", colorby="events")
2. create_strike_zone_plot(statcast_game_data, title="{team1} @ {team2} - \
Pitch Locations • {date}", colorby="pitch_type")
3. create_bb_profile_plot(statcast_game_data, parameter="exit_velocity", title="{team1} @ {team2} - Exit Velocity Distribution • {date}")
4. create_bb_profile_plot(statcast_game_data, parameter="release_speed", title="{team1} @ {team2} - Pitch Velocity Distribution • {date}")
5. create_strike_zone_plot(statcast_game_data, title="{team1} @ {team2} - \
Strike Zone by Outcome • {date}", colorby="events")

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Each plotting function returns a response with image_base64 field containing the base64 string
- Extract the image_base64 value and use it as plot_base64 in your response
- Create descriptive titles that include the teams and date for context
- Only return the JSON list format specified above
- Do not include any explanatory text, only the JSON list of plot objects
- Use get_statcast_single_game() as the primary data source for all plots"""
