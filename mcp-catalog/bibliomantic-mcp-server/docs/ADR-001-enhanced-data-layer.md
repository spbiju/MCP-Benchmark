# ADR-001: Enhanced I Ching Data Layer Implementation

**Status:** Implemented  
**Date:** 2025-06-10  
**Decision Makers:** Development Team

## Context

The original I Ching server provided simplified interpretations that, while functional, lacked the depth and authenticity expected from a traditional divination system.

## Decision

Implement a modular enhanced data layer that provides rich traditional content while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

### Architecture Components:

1. **EnhancedIChing Class**: Core engine with complete traditional data
2. **IChingAdapter**: Compatibility layer maintaining existing interface  
3. **EnhancedBiblioManticDiviner**: Enhanced divination with backward compatibility
4. **Enhanced Server**: Drop-in replacement for existing MCP server

### Backward Compatibility Strategy:

- Adapter pattern preserves all existing method signatures
- Enhanced features are additive, never replacing existing functionality
- Graceful fallback to basic mode if enhanced features unavailable
- Same MCP tool names and parameter structures

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Dramatically improved content quality and authenticity
- Zero breaking changes to production agents
- Rich traditional I Ching experience for new clients
- Gradual migration path allows testing and rollback

### Negative:
- Increased codebase complexity
- Additional maintenance overhead
- Larger memory footprint with full traditional data

## Implementation Notes

- Enhanced hexagrams include full traditional elements
- Changing line calculations use proper three-coin method
- Context inference provides targeted interpretations
- King Wen sequence ensures authentic hexagram mapping
