# Bibliomantic MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server that integrates I Ching divination with AI responses, exploring the bibliomantic approach described in Philip K. Dick's *The Man in the High Castle*.

## Purpose

This server demonstrates how traditional wisdom systems can be thoughtfully integrated with modern AI through MCP. It provides:

- **Educational exploration** of ancient Chinese philosophy and the I Ching
- **Literary context** from Philip K. Dick's influential science fiction work
- **Philosophical reflection tools** for creative thinking and perspective-taking
- **Technical demonstration** of FastMCP capabilities with tools, resources, and prompts

## Features

- **Traditional I Ching System**: All 64 hexagrams with authentic three-coin method simulation
- **Bibliomantic Consultation**: Following Philip K. Dick's approach from "The Man in the High Castle"
- **FastMCP Implementation**: Professional MCP compliance with tools, resources, and prompts
- **Ethical Safeguards**: Clear disclaimers about entertainment/reflection purpose
- **Educational Context**: Historical and philosophical background for each consultation
- **Resource Access**: Direct hexagram database access for AI context loading

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (required by MCP SDK)
- **MCP-compatible host** (Claude Desktop, etc.)

## Installation

### Using uvx (recommended)
```bash
uvx bibliomantic-mcp-server
```

### Using pip
```bash
pip install bibliomantic-mcp-server
```

### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dshields/bibliomantic-mcp-server.git
cd bibliomantic-mcp-server
pip install -e .
```

## Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bibliomantic": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["bibliomantic-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternative configurations:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bibliomantic": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "bibliomantic_server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

- **`i_ching_divination`** - Generate random hexagrams with traditional interpretations
- **`bibliomantic_consultation`** - Full bibliomantic process with query augmentation  
- **`get_hexagram_details`** - Look up specific hexagrams by number (1-64)
- **`server_statistics`** - View system information and capabilities

## Resources

- **`hexagram://{number}`** - Load individual hexagram data for AI context
- **`iching://database`** - Access complete 64-hexagram database overview

## Prompt Templates

- **`career_guidance_prompt`** - Structured prompts for career decisions
- **`creative_guidance_prompt`** - Prompts for artistic and creative projects
- **`general_guidance_prompt`** - Universal life guidance templates

## Usage Examples

### Basic Divination
Ask Claude:
> *"Can you perform an I Ching divination for philosophical guidance on my creative projects?"*

### Bibliomantic Consultation
> *"I'm facing a difficult decision about my career path. Can you consult the I Ching using the bibliomantic approach?"*

### Resource Access
> *"Load the hexagram://1 resource to understand The Creative."*

### Specific Hexagram Lookup
> *"Can you tell me about I Ching hexagram number 42?"*

## The Bibliomantic Approach

This implementation follows the divination method described in Philip K. Dick's *The Man in the High Castle*, where characters consult the I Ching for guidance on important decisions. The system:

- Uses traditional I Ching methodology with three-coin tosses
- Generates cryptographically secure randomness for authentic divination
- Integrates ancient wisdom with modern AI capabilities
- Maintains the philosophical and reflective aspects of bibliomancy
- Provides transparency in the divination process

## Ethical Framework

All responses include clear disclaimers that this is for **philosophical reflection and entertainment only**, not supernatural guidance or life advice. Users are directed to consult qualified professionals for important decisions.

The server emphasizes:
- Educational exploration of wisdom traditions
- Creative thinking and perspective-taking
- Philosophical reflection rather than prediction
- Respect for both ancient traditions and modern ethical standards

## Development

### Testing with MCP Inspector
```bash
mcp dev bibliomantic_server.py
```

### Running locally
```bash
python bibliomantic_server.py
```

## Technical Implementation

Built with:
- **FastMCP** - Official MCP Python SDK for professional compliance
- **Traditional I Ching** - Complete 64-hexagram database with authentic interpretations
- **Cryptographic randomness** - Secure three-coin simulation using Python's `secrets` module
- **Type safety** - Full type hints with automatic JSON schema generation
- **Ethical safeguards** - User-facing disclaimers in all responses

## Use Cases

- **Educational tool** for learning about I Ching philosophy and Chinese wisdom traditions
- **Creative writing aid** for generating new perspectives and inspiration
- **Philosophical reflection** tool for contemplating life decisions and changes
- **Cultural bridge** between ancient wisdom and modern AI capabilities
- **Technical demonstration** of MCP server development with cultural content
- **Literary analysis** of Philip K. Dick's themes and bibliomantic concepts

## Security Considerations

- Input validation for all user queries and parameters
- No external network requests or API dependencies
- Cryptographically secure randomness generation
- Clear ethical boundaries and user education
- No persistent data storage or user tracking
