## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Statistical functions (sum, average, min, max)
- Rounding functions (floor, ceiling, round)

## Installation
### Installing via Smithery

To install Math-MCP for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@EthanHenrickson/math-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @EthanHenrickson/math-mcp --client claude
```

### Installing Manually

Just clone this repository and save it locally somewhere on your computer.

Then add this server to your MCP configuration file:

```json
"math": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["PATH\\TO\\PROJECT\\math-mcp\\build\\index.js"]
}
```

Replace `PATH\\TO\\PROJECT` with the actual path to where you cloned the repository.
