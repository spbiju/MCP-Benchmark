## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install Hugeicons MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@hugeicons/mcp-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @hugeicons/mcp-server --client claude
```

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hugeicons": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@hugeicons/mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The args array specifies:
1. `-y`: Automatically answer "yes" to npx prompts
2. Package name: `@hugeicons/mcp-server`

### Quick Start

You can also run the server directly using npx:

```bash
npx @hugeicons/mcp-server
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
